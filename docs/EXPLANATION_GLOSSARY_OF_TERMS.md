# Glossary of Language Specific to Peer to Peer Texting

This guide is here for those who haven't heard all of the terminology used in the world of Spoke. This is a living document: you should feel free to either add words that you don't understand with the hopes of someone filling in the definition, or fill out definitions if you know them!

**Peer to Peer Texting**
Peer to peer texting allows organizations to recruit people to send text messages to a list of contacts. Peer to peer texting apps (like Spoke) create an interface for senders to easily send large quantities of texts while sticking to a script that an admin has created.

**Interaction Steps**
An admin creates a script made out of both what a texter should say given pre-estimated responses that they expect from the people receiving the texts. Each new line in the script that anticipates a potential response from a recipient is referred to as an "interaction step" in Spoke.
